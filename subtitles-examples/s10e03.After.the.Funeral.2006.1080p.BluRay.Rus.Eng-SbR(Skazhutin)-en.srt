We're going to see her, yes.

178
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,924
But unfortunately,
we can't ask her to explain.

179
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,093
You see, yesterday afternoon,

180
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,346
Cora was hacked to death
by an intruder with a hatchet.

181
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:18,701
The doctor puts the murder
in the afternoon,

182
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:22,038
no later than 4:30,
probably much nearer 2:00.

183
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,165
Somebody smashed
the kitchen window

184
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,626
and attacked Mrs. Gallaccio
in her bed.

185
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,711
A particularly brutal attack,
as you saw.

186
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,380
Six or seven blows were struck.

187
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,758
She was in her bed
during the daytime?

188
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,801
She'd slept badly.

189
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,095
She sent the companion
into Reading

190
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,472
to exchange some library books

191
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,140
and took a couple
of sleeping pills.

192
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,433
So she'd have been drowsy

193
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,393
if not already asleep
when they broke in.

194
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:48,898
So a hatchet seems, well,
excessive, to say the least.

195
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,777
I suppose the companion
could have done it.

196
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,779
Two women living together alone.

197
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,657
You never know what quarrels
and resentments build up.

198
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,158
But by all accounts,
they got on well.

199
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,077
And was anything stolen,
Inspector?

200
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,787
Just a few bits and pieces
of jewelry.

201
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:03,788
Nothing of any value.

202
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,414
And they could have taken
whatever they wanted.

203
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,626
And this is the odd thing.

204
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,129
We found them shoved in a hedge
not far from the cottage.

205
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,174
I suppose the murderer
may have had a sudden panic

206
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,550
or a fit of remorse.

207
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,805
But in my experience
of criminals, it's unusual.

208
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,183
So, with your permission
of course, Inspector,

209
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,644
I would like to pay a visit
to this companion.

210
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,020
Oh, please do.

211
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,647
She's a sensible enough woman.

212
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,565
Let me know if she says
anything new.

213
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,901
<i>Oui. Merci.</i>

214
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,028
ENTWHISTLE: And then,
on top of everything else,

215
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,738
I discovered there was
a break-in at the office

216
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:38,948
on the day of the funeral.

217
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,658
The Enderby deeds are missing,

218
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,035
and I haven't had a chance
to attend to it.

219
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,704
But if the deeds are missing...

220
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:45,705
The house can't be sold

221
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,748
and the family can't get
their share of the money.

222
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,126
A break-in
on the day of the funeral.

223
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,128
The deeds of the house
go missing.

224
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,046
This is indeed
a big coincidence,

225
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,047
<i>n'est-ce pas, monsieur?</i>

226
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,549
Yes, I suppose it is.

227
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:57,800
Listen, Poirot.

228
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,052
You <i>will</i> take the case on,
won't you?

229
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,013
It would be a great favor to me
if you did.

230
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:09,979
<i>Oui, monsieur.</i>
I will take the case.

231
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,773
MISS GILCHRIST: The inspector
assures me she didn't suffer.

232
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,359
The first blow
would have killed her.

233
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,820
Oh, dear, I do hope so.

234
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,781
I'm so glad you've come,
Mr. Entwhistle.

Mademoiselle.

237
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,703
I don't know Mrs. Gallaccio's
family.

238
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,998
I'm rather nervous
about meeting them.

239
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:35,421
Mrs. Gallaccio bought them
at sales.

240
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,006
She always thought
there was a chance

241
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,175
of picking up something
worthwhile.

242
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:49,351
They're Mrs. Gallaccio's
own paintings.

243
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,561
They're very good, aren't they?

244
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,229
<i>Oui.</i>

245
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,400
Of course,
I don't know enough to judge,

246
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,235
although my father was
a painter.

247
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,863
Not a very successful one,
unfortunately.

248
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:04,784
But Mrs. Gallaccio knew a great
deal about artistic things,

249
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,285

Yes.

253
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,883
She liked to paint in here.

254
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,261
And you got on well with
your employer, mademoiselle?

255
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,346
Oh, yes.

256
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,182
In some ways,
she was rather like a child.

257
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,142
She was not an intellectual.

258
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,686
MISS GILCHRIST:
Perhaps more of an instinctive.

259
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,605
But she was very shrewd,
Mr. Entwhistle.

260
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,774
It quite surprised me sometimes

261
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,193
how she hit the nail
on the head.

262
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,904
And you had been with her
for a long time, huh?

263
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,614
– Three and a half years.
– Ah.

264
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:48,327
You acted as companion
and, uh, looked after the house?

265
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,080
I did the cooking
and light dusting.

266
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,748
None of the rough.

267
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,335
Mrs. Panter from the village
came in for that.

268
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,505
I don't think of myself
as a servant, Mr. Entwhistle.

269
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,258
I would very much like to see
the bedroom of Mme. Gallaccio --

Did Cora talk
about her brother's funeral?

She said the chapel was filled
with flowers.

278
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,913
She was very sorry not to see
her other brother -- Timothy?

Oh, dear.
That sounds as if I'm boasting.

No, no, no.
Not at all.

How was Mme. Gallaccio when she
returned from the funeral?

The night she got back,

290
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,452
she was happier
than I'd seen her for some time.

291

She asked me if I'd like to go
to South America.

I said it would be a thing
to dream about.

that I investigate
the death of Cora only.

368

That way, we may be able
to catch them off their guard.

It is necessary

Although I can't think
why anyone would want to murder

392

I was to meet my friend Jane,
but we missed each other.

So I had a lovely day shopping.

from the real life.

1730
01:26:07,954 --> 01:26:11,249
You told that to us,
Mlle. Gilchrist.

1731
01:26:11,457 --> 01:26:14,127
And then I remembered the smell
of the oil paint

1732
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:17,046
as soon as I arrived
at the cottage.

1733
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:19,090
You can paint, can you not?

1734
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:21,718
And you know a great deal
about painting

1735
01:26:21,926 --> 01:26:24,554
because your father,
he was an artist, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

1736
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:27,223
And then Richard Abernethie,
he dies suddenly,

1737
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:29,934
and the plan,
it sprang into your mind.

1738
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:31,895
How easy for you
to administer a sedative

1739
01:26:32,103 --> 01:26:33,229
in her morning cup of tea

1740
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:36,107
to render her unconscious
for the day of the funeral

1741
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:40,028
while you play her part
at Enderby.

1742
01:26:42,113 --> 01:26:43,489
Oh, and you knew Enderby well

1743
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:46,618
from hearing
Cora Gallaccio speak of it.

1744
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:50,580
So simple, then, to begin
with a remark to M. Lanscombe,

1745
01:26:50,788 --> 01:26:52,540
well, to convince him
of your identity.

1746
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:54,918
Dear, dear Lanscombe.

1747
01:26:55,126 --> 01:26:58,630
Do you remember
when you used to bring meringues

1748
01:26:58,838 --> 01:27:00,590
out to the tree house for us?

1749
01:27:00,798 --> 01:27:01,633
But that's preposterous.

1750
01:27:01,841 --> 01:27:03,301
Nobody would have been fooled
for a moment.

1751
01:27:03,509 --> 01:27:07,513
But nobody had seen Cora
Gallaccio for over 20 years.

1752
01:27:08,014 --> 01:27:08,806
You wore her clothes.

1753
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:11,017
You padded yourself out
to show her gain in weight.

1754
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:14,020
No one would have suspected that
you were not Cora Gallaccio.

1755
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:16,439
And because Cora Gallaccio
always wore

1756
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:21,653
the hair that was false,
it was easy for you.

1757
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:25,740
But mannerisms are remembered.

1758
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:27,659
And Cora Gallaccio
had mannerisms

1759
01:27:27,867 --> 01:27:30,078
that were most definite.

1760
01:27:30,286 --> 01:27:34,958
All of which you practiced most
carefully in front of a mirror.

1761
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:39,087
And that was where you made
your first mistake.

1762
01:27:39,295 --> 01:27:43,299
You forgot that an image in
a mirror, it is always reversed.

1763
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:47,679
So when you observed your
reproduction -- oh, <i>parfait –</i>

1764
01:27:47,887 --> 01:27:51,140
of the birdlike tilt
of the head of Cora Gallaccio,

1765
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:53,101
you forgot
it was the wrong way around.

1766
01:27:53,309 --> 01:27:58,106
And it was this that puzzled
Mme. Helen Abernethie

1767
01:27:58,314 --> 01:28:00,608
at the moment that you made
your insinuation.

1768
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:03,027
She could not quite
put her finger on what it was.

1769
01:28:03,236 --> 01:28:04,988
But then with all the talk
about mirror images

1770
01:28:05,196 --> 01:28:08,116
and how one sees oneself
as others see us...

1771
01:28:10,743 --> 01:28:12,662
...she remembered.

1772
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:20,169
So she tiptoed downstairs
to make a telephone call.

1773
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:21,921
[ Bell chimes,
telephone clicks ]

1774
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:24,173
But someone else was about.

1775
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:26,676
And they followed her down
to listen in.

1776
01:28:26,884 --> 01:28:30,638
And, fearful of what revelations
she was about to make,

1777
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:32,140
struck her over the head
with a --

1778

I never did anything
of the sort.

1779

The whole thing is a wicked,
wicked lie.

1780
01:28:36,227 --> 01:28:37,645
It was you that day.

1781
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:42,525
When we arrived, I vaguely felt
I'd seen you before.

1782

But, of course,

No.

a mere companion help.

1786
01:28:50,616 --> 01:28:51,451
But go on, Mr. Poirot.

1787
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:54,245
Go on with this fantastic piece
of nonsense.

1788

<i>Merci, mademoiselle.</i>

I intend to.

1790
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:04,088
And then, to cover yourself
still further,

1791
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:07,342
you planted a letter,

1792
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:09,927
from Richard Abernethie
to his sister --

1793
01:29:10,136 --> 01:29:11,346
of course, in a place

1794
01:29:11,554 --> 01:29:14,015
where somebody would be bound
to find it.

1795
01:29:14,223 --> 01:29:16,809
And in this letter,
there was a phrase,

1796
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:18,644
oh, so cryptic,

1797
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:22,315
telling her that he had not long
to live.

1798
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:25,985
And then you actually poison
yourself with arsenic --

1799
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:27,737
badly but not fatally.

1800
01:29:27,945 --> 01:29:31,032
Mademoiselle, you know, that is
a device that is also very old.

1801
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:34,994
It aroused my suspicions
but immediately.

1802
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:37,246
And what about the picture
of Polflexan?

1803
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:38,498
Ah.

1804
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:41,959
I commissioned the valuer
of painting Signore Gallaccio

1805
01:29:42,168 --> 01:29:45,254
to go to the cottage,
remove the painting,

1806
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:48,299
and take it
to the London Academy of art.

You don't know
how truly stultifying it is

to listen to someone talking
about the same things

"Oh, yes, Mrs. Gallaccio,"
and, "Really, Mrs. Gallaccio?"

And in truth just bored,
bored, bored.

but more of the same.

for £5,000.
