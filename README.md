# Bilingua Dealer

Bilingua is a text (book), which contains some original text, and its translation (bilingual book).

## Bilingua Dealer is a server-less web-application which allows:

- Create a bilingua book (with original text, and some translation service like Google-translation).
- Read bilingua books.
- Edit bilingua books.
- Learn the foreign language, using additional functionality like "fragments".
- Listen the original text, using a speech-engine.
- It automatically copies the selected text (or the clicked word) to clipboard,
  so that you can integrate it with a dictionary, which can observe clipboard (GoldenDict, for example).
- Save the bilingua book as a json-file, import it from the json-file.

This application can be also used as a good book-reader.

It can be used offline. All data is stored in your web-browser. It doesn't use any server.

You can read very big books without any technical troubles.

It's better to use on desktop, but it's also optimized for smartphones.

You should use modern updated web-browsers, Chrome is the best choice.
